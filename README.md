# Final-NLP-Project
1. IPYNB files are independent of each other so opening any one will not depend on other
2. .py files are somewhat dependent
3. before running topic_model.py file  run wiki.py file to create your own dataset
4. now feel free to  run any python file other than final.py
5. every python file will save the  model  for further use
6. after every thing is done (it will a lot of time to train and save the model) you can terminate every python file
7. Now finally run only final.py file , it will load the saved model and takes input from you and gives you the predicted output

dataset for sentiment.py file is not provided becoz of  its large size(500 mb) so sorry for it , simply search the name of file used on the internet you will find from kaggle

if you dont want to run anything then just copy every model from model folder and put it in the same folder as final.py and run final.py , only few libraries should be installed   for it.

NOTE : INSTALL THE LIBRARY USED IN THE CODE
